Goal:
    a)  1 Euler Project per every week or two
    b)  Write Code in C
    c)  Keep preference to lighter more functional code
    d)  When possible, have generalized solutions requiring console input


NOTUM BONUM:
    Per Euler Project's request, I am limited to only posting the first 100 solutions
    here on GitHub.
    This is primarily for demonstration and reference for later.  I hope to grow in my
    programming capabilities alongside any others interested in solving fun and quirky
    problems!
